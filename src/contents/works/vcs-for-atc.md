I had the privilege to contribute to the advancement of a crucial component in air traffic control – the Voice Communication System (VCS). Samtech, our esteemed client, sought to upgrade the existing system to achieve higher levels of reliability and responsiveness. My role in this significant project was to revamp the user interface (UI) of the VCS.

## Problem Statement

The challenge lay in balancing modern design principles with the constraints posed by the system's backend, which was rewritten in C and C++. The primary focus was on maintaining simplicity in UI design to align with the VCS's core purpose: ensuring fast and reliable communication in all scenarios.

## Your Role and Responsibilities

As the UI designer for this project, my responsibilities included understanding the intricate requirements of air traffic control, translating them into an intuitive interface, and ensuring a seamless user experience. The decision to streamline the UI complexity was a strategic choice, considering the technical limitations of the backend.

## Solution

I redesigned the UI with a focus on improving usability and overall user experience. Despite the constraints imposed by the backend technologies, I implemented a touch-friendly interface, making it easier for air traffic controllers to interact with the system efficiently. Additionally, I introduced an innovative theme that automatically adjusted between light and dark modes based on the time of day, enhancing user comfort during extended usage.

## Key Features

Improved usability through a streamlined UI design.
Implementation of a touch-friendly interface for enhanced interaction.
Dynamic theme adjustment for optimal user comfort – light mode for day, dark mode for night.

## Results and Impact

The revamped UI received positive feedback from users, who appreciated its intuitive design and visually appealing elements. The touch-friendly interface significantly improved the overall user experience, contributing to smoother interactions within the air traffic control environment. The dynamic theme adjustment was well-received, aligning the system with the natural circadian rhythm and reducing eye strain during extended usage.

## Conclusion

I take pride in contributing to the modernization of the Voice Communication System, ensuring it remains a reliable and user-friendly tool for air traffic controllers. The positive reception from users underscores the success of the UI redesign in making their critical tasks more efficient and visually engaging.
