I had the privilege to contribute to the advancement of a crucial component in air traffic control – the Voice Communication System (VCS). Samtech, an esteemed client, sought to upgrade the existing system to achieve higher levels of reliability and accessibility. My role in this significant project was to revamp the user interface (UI) of the VCS.

## Problem Statement

The challenge lay in balancing modern design principles with the constraints posed by the system's backend, which was rewritten in C and C++. The primary focus was on maintaining simplicity in UI design to align with the VCS's core purpose: ensuring fast and reliable communication in all scenarios.

After examining the old design, I identified three key areas that need improvement:

1. limiting & regulating the use of color. By restricting colors to be used only for communication and relaying information, the interface will gain needed breathing space, a calmer feeling, and more laser-focused two-way interactions.
2. implementing light and dark themes capable of automatic switching based on the time of day is imperative.
3. ensuring the interface is compatible with modern wide and multi-touch screens.

## Role and Responsibilities

As the UI designer for this project, my responsibilities included understanding the intricate requirements of air traffic control, translating them into an intuitive interface, and ensuring a seamless user experience. The decision to streamline the UI complexity was a strategic choice, considering the technical limitations of the backend.

## Solution

I redesigned the UI with a focus on improving usability and overall user experience. Despite the constraints imposed by the backend technologies, I implemented a touch-friendly interface, making it easier for air traffic controllers to interact with the system efficiently. Additionally, I introduced an innovative theme that automatically adjusted between light and dark modes based on the time of day, enhancing user comfort during extended usage.

## Key Features

- Improved usability through a streamlined UI design.
- Implementation of a touch-friendly interface for enhanced interaction.
- Dynamic theme adjustment for optimal user comfort – light mode for day, dark mode for night.

### Unveiling the True Potential of Color in Design

n the current design, color serves merely as a tool for interface segmentation, resulting in a dual challenge of clutter and ineffective communication of vital updates to the user. To address this, our primary focus should be on streamlining and adopting a minimalist design approach.

By minimizing the utilization of the base color, we create ample space for critical alerts and changes to take center stage. A deliberate restriction on the spectrum of colors for communication purposes enhances the user experience by providing clear and immediate meaning to updates. Adhering to established design patterns ensures a swift and direct line of communication with the user.

### Harnessing Themes for Enhanced Accessibility

Our interface revolves around two core themes – light and dark – strategically chosen to optimize accessibility in varying environmental conditions. These themes cater to both bright daylight scenarios and low-light nights of watchtowers.

In environments where the operator may be stationed near a window, the high-contrast light theme ensures readability and comprehension under direct sunlight. Conversely, the dark theme not only minimizes eye strain in low-light settings but also conserves power, contributing to the device's longevity – a crucial factor for sustained operational efficiency.

## Results and Impact

The revamped UI received positive feedback from users, who appreciated its intuitive design and visually appealing elements. The touch-friendly interface significantly improved the overall user experience, contributing to smoother interactions within the air traffic control environment. The dynamic theme adjustment was well-received, aligning the system with the natural circadian rhythm and reducing eye strain during extended usage.

## Conclusion

I take pride in contributing to the modernization of the Voice Communication System, ensuring it remains a reliable and user-friendly tool for air traffic controllers. The positive reception from users underscores the success of the UI redesign in making their critical tasks more efficient and visually engaging.
